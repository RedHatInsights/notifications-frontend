# Welcome to Notifications Frontend Storybook

Welcome to the **Red Hat Console Notifications Frontend** component library! This Storybook showcases all the reusable components, design patterns, and documentation for our notifications and integrations management system.

## What is Notifications Frontend?

The Notifications Frontend is a React application that provides:

- **Notification Management** - Configure how you receive notifications for events
- **Behavior Groups** - Define notification behaviors for different event types
- **Integration Endpoints** - Manage webhooks, email, and third-party integrations
- **Event Log** - View the history of events and notifications
- **Notifications Drawer** - Real-time notification display in the console

## Architecture Overview

Our application is built with modern React patterns and integrates with the Red Hat Console platform:

### Key Technologies
- **React 18** with functional components and hooks
- **react-fetching-library** for API requests
- **PatternFly 6** for design system and components
- **React Router 6** for navigation
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **react-intl** for internationalization
- **Jest & Cypress** for testing

### Integration Points
- **Red Hat Console Chrome** - Platform integration via `useChrome`
- **Notifications Backend API** - Event and notification management
- **Integrations Backend API** - Endpoint and webhook management
- **Feature Flags (Unleash)** - Feature toggling via `useFlag`

- **Usage examples** - Common patterns and implementations
- **Design guidelines** - When and how to use components

## Context & Permissions Testing

Our Storybook includes a context mocking system that allows you to test components with different:

### Permission Contexts
- **canWriteNotifications** - Create/edit notification configurations
- **canReadNotifications** - View notification settings
- **canWriteIntegrationsEndpoints** - Create/edit integration endpoints
- **canReadIntegrationsEndpoints** - View integrations
- **canReadEvents** - View event log

### Environment Contexts
- **Production** - Prod environment behavior
- **Staging** - Stage environment features

## Getting Started

### For Developers
1. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
2. **Start Storybook**: `npm run storybook`
3. **Build Storybook**: `npm run build-storybook`

### For Designers
- Browse components in the **Components** section
- Use the **Controls** panel to experiment with different states
- Check the **Docs** tab for detailed usage guidelines

## Contributing

### Adding New Stories
When creating new components, always include:
- Comprehensive prop documentation
- Multiple usage examples
- Different state variations
- Accessibility considerations

### Story File Naming
- Place stories next to their component: `Component.stories.tsx`
- Use descriptive story names that explain the variant

### Documentation Standards
- Use descriptive story names
- Include context about when to use components
- Document any special behaviors or limitations

## Design Principles

### Consistency
- Follow PatternFly design guidelines
